== Welcome to GolfManager

!! Application under development !!

GolfManager is a simple golf performance tracking system. It allows players to enter
new course or a new score card.

Players can then see all their played rounds and GolfManager computes statistics like the
player average score, the average of hit fairways or greens reached in regulation.
